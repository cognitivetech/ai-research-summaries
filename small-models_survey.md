### 2.1.3 Efficient Inference Model Ensembling

**Model Ensembling**
- Larger models are more powerful but have significant costs, including slower inference speed and higher API prices
- Smaller models offer advantages in terms of lower cost and faster inference, especially for simple queries
- Ensemble methods can be used to achieve cost-effective inference by combining multiple models of varying sizes
  - Model cascading: sequential use of multiple models, where each model has a different level of complexity
    * Output of one model triggers activation of next model in sequence
    * Allows for collaboration between models and transferring tasks to larger models
    * Critical step is determining when to escalate query to more complex model
      - Techniques train small evaluator to assess correctness, confidence, or quality of model output
        * Some LLMs can perform self-verification and provide confidence levels

    * Straightforward approach: select best-performing model from all models
      * Does not significantly reduce inference costs
    * Efficient, reward-based routers trained to select optimal models without accessing their outputs
      * Retrieval-based dynamic router assigns instances with similar semantic embeddings to same expert
        * RouteLLM uses human preference data and data augmentation to train small router model
      * FORC proposes meta-model to assign queries to most suitable model without requiring execution of large models

**Speculative Decoding**

- Auxiliary model generates multiple token candidates in parallel, which are then verified or refined by larger model

### 2.1.4 Evaluating LLMs Effectively

**Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs)**
* Traditional evaluation methods like BLEU and ROUGE have limitations for capturing nuanced semantic meaning and compositional diversity of generated text

	+ BARTSCORE for various perspectives including informativeness, fluency, and factuality (Yuan et al., 2021)
* Some methods use small natural language infer- ence (NLI) models to estimate uncertainty of LLM responses
* Proxy models can be employed to predict LLM performance, reducing computational costs during model selection.

**Future Directions**
* As large models generate longer and more complex texts, it becomes essential to develop efficient evaluators for assessing various aspects:
	+ Factuality (Min et al., 2023b)
	+ Safety (Zhang et al., 2024b)
	+ Uncertainty (Huang et al., 2023).

### 2.1.5 Domain Adaptation

**Domain Adaptation for Large Language Models (LLMs)**

**Background:**
- LLMs require further customization for optimal performance in specific use cases and domains
- Fine-tuning on specialized data is resource-intensive and not always feasible
- Recent research explores adapting LLMs using smaller models

**Two Approaches:**1. **White-Box Adaptation:**
   - Involves fine-tuning a small model to adjust token distributions of frozen LLMs for specific domains
   - Examples: CombLM (Ormazabal et al., 2023), IPA (Lu et al., 2023b), Proxy-tuning (Liu et al., 2024a)
   - Only modify small domain-specific experts' parameters, allowing LLMs to be adapted to specific tasks
2. **Black-Box Adaptation:**
   - Involves using a small domain-specific model to guide LLMs toward target domains by providing textual relevant knowledge
   - Examples: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
   - Enhances base LLM's performance without requiring access to internal model parameters

**Summary:**
- Fine-tuning large models for specific domains is resource-intensive
- Adapting LLMs using smaller domain-specific models offers a cost-effective solution
- **White-Box Adaptation**: fine-tunes small models and guides base models during decoding
- **Black-Box Adaptation**: uses small expert models to provide textual relevant knowledge, enhancing the base model's understanding of domain-specific knowledge

**Future Directions:**1. Develop techniques for adapting LLMs using a broader range of diverse models 2. Investigate methods to adapt LLMs using a limited number of samples (Sun et al., 2024).

### 2.1.6 Retrieval Augmented Generation

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

**Background:**
- LLMs exhibit reasoning capabilities but limited memory
- Struggle with domain expertise and up-to-date information
- RAG enhances LLMs by using a lightweight retriever to access external knowledge bases, document collections, or other tools

**Advantages:**

- Categories of Retrieval Sources: Textual Documents, Structured Knowledge, Other Sources

**Textual Document Sources:**
- Most commonly used in RAG methods
- Encompasses resources such as Wikipedia, cross-lingual text, and domain-specific corpus
- Lightweight retrievers like sparse BM25 or dense BERT-based models are employed

**Structured Knowledge Sources:**
- Verified information from knowledge bases and databases
- Enhances answers by concatenating retrieved tables with queries (KnowledgeGPT, T-RAG)
- Retriever can be a lightweight entity linker, query executor, or API

**Other Sources:**
- Codes, tools, images enabling LLMs to leverage external information for enhanced reasoning (DocPrompting, Toolformer)

**Future Directions:**1. Develop robust approaches to integrate noisy retrieved texts2. Extend RAG to multimodal scenarios beyond text-only information (images, audios)

### 2.1.7 Prompt-based Learning

**Prompt-Based Learning**

**Definition**: Paradigm for few-shot or zero-shot learning where prompts are crafted to facilitate adaptation to new scenarios with minimal labeled data.

**Advantages**: Leverages In-Context Learning (ICL), operates without parameter updates, and can use small models to enhance performance.

**Techniques**: Uprise - optimizes a lightweight retriever for zero-shot tasks; DaSLaM - uses a small model to break down complex problems into subproblems; generating pseudo labels or verifying/rewriting outputs of LLMs using small models.

**Summary**: Efficient process handling complex tasks without the need for parameter updates, using prompts embedded in natural language templates and small models to augment performance.

- Small models can be used to repair these defects

**Two Ways to Achieve Deficiency Repair**:1. **Contrastive Decoding**: Chooses tokens that maximize the log-likelihood difference between a larger model (expert) and a smaller model (amateur)2. **Small Model Plugins**: Fine-tune a specialized small model to address the shortcomings of a larger model
  - Address unseen words (Out-Of-Vocabulary) by training a small model to mimic the behavior of the large model
  - Detect hallucinations or calibrate confidence scores

**Summary and Future Directions**:
- Existing work explores synergistic use of logits from both LLMs and SMs to reduce repeated text, mitigate hallucinations, augment reasoning capabilities, and safeguard user privacy
- **Proxy Tuning**: Fine-tunes a small model and contrasts the difference between the original LLMs and small models to adapt to the target task
- Future Directions:
  - Extend the use of small models to fix flaws of large models in other problems, e.g., mathematical reasoning
  - Expand the range of knowledge transferred from the teacher model, including feedback on the student's outputs and feature knowledge
  - Address trustworthiness issues (helpfulness, honesty, harmlessness) when transferring skills from LLMs to small models

**Knowledge Distillation**:
- Scaling models to larger sizes is computationally expensive
- Knowledge Distillation offers an effective solution by training a smaller student model to replicate the behavior of a larger teacher model
  - White-box distillation involves using internal states of the teacher model, providing transparency in the training process
  - Black-box knowledge distillation typically involves generating a distillation dataset through the teacher LLM and using it for fine-tuning the student model
- Recent advancements include Chain-of-Thought distillation and Instruction Following Distillation to enhance reasoning abilities of smaller models

**Data Synthesis**:
